# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

The Article Summarizer Application is a powerful React-based tool designed to simplify lengthy articles into concise, easy-to-read summaries. Built with Tailwind CSS for a clean and responsive design, it ensures a seamless and modern user experience. The application leverages React Hooks, such as useState and useEffect, for efficient state and lifecycle management, enhancing interactivity and performance. By integrating with RapidAPI, it utilizes advanced natural language processing (NLP) capabilities to deliver accurate and precise article summaries. Users can input article links, and the app instantly generates a summary, making it an excellent solution for quick insights. Optimized for speed and scalability, this project serves as a valuable learning resource for developers interested in mastering React, Tailwind CSS, and API integration.
